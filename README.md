  ### Installation
  Here is a video tutorial made by myself on how to install, run, and test this application. https://youtu.be/R4W4oDcks10

  First to install, click the "Code" button and download the zip file,
  next extract it to wherever you'd like. 
  
  Second, open it with VS Code assuming that is what you are using as your text editor and use Node.js to run it.

  Third, after it is in VS Code, open a intergrated terminal by right clicking on the left and selecting the option.
  Next initialize the folder by typing in the console "npm init"
  After that type the command to install the dependances/node_modules for the project
  by typing "npm i".

  Forth, to run the application type "node app.js" and you will be prompted 
  with a series of questions for the manager card. After you fill those out you will be given the choice of which types of employees you'd like to add cards for that comes with another series of questions. 

  After you answer the questions the HTML should be successfully generated and will show up in the "output" folder.

  ### Usage
  As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and Github profiles

  ### Testing
  Testing was done with npm jest
